## History and differences with Microsoft Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ

The Azure Toolkit for [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider) is a fork of the [Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/azure/intellij/azure-toolkit-for-intellij-installation), available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-tools-for-java).

Microsoft's Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ provides similar functionality to the Azure plugin for [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider), however focus on the Java/JVM ecosystem and development flows. JetBrains decided to fork the original plugin, and split base functionality (such as browsing Azure resources) from Java/JVM-specific features (such as deploying a `.war` file to the HDInsight service).

The Azure Toolkit for [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider) is released with several notable differences:

* No telemetry or usage data is collected and sent to Microsoft
* Icons have been replaced by custom icons, as [the original icons are not open-source](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-tools-for-java/issues/1626)
* Java/JVM-specific functionality was removed
* .NET-specific functionality, such as deploying an ASP.NET web application, has been added

JetBrains [opened a pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-tools-for-java/pull/1725) to Microsoft's Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ as well, which would contribute this effort back to the original plugin, and open up the original plugin to various other ecosystems.
